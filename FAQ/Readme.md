## Cloud installation errors and warnings :

* 1. IF I get an "SSH error saying the connection is not secure" error or warning while connecting to your VM (If you delete a VM instance that you have already connected to through SSH, 
and then create a new one that happens to have the same connection IP address), what do I need to do?. (Relevant to Mac users )

* * Answer: To fix this, you need to open the "known_hosts"  text file in the ~/.ssh directory and delete the entry with the matching IP address. You can then connect again.
